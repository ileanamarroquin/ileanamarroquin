### Welcome to my GitHub! ✨

My name is Ileana, and I am a passionate development economist and data analysis enthusiast based in the United States. Along with my diverse academic and professional background, I bring a unique perspective to the world of evidence-based public policy.

Currently, I am working on building my own data analysis portfolio, and I'm bringing some of my research interests to you here. My analyst toolkit includes RStudio and STATA, and I'm soon to add SQL and Python skills as I teach myself ⚡. Stay tuned for updates on new data projects!

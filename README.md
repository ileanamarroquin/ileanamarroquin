### Welcome to my GitHub! âœ¨

I'm a passionate data analyst and analytics expert specializing in capacity building. My research interests lie in the intersection of public management and capacity building.  Prior to graduate school, I gained practical experience as a consultant in Geneva, Washington D.C., Costa Rica, and El Salvador, applying my skills to real-world challenges.  Currently, I consult for the World Bank, contributing to their evidence-based policy implementation agenda.

Beyond my analytical and research work, I'm committed to academic mentorship, particularly for Latinx individuals navigating the academic world.  Whether you're a first-generation student like myself or simply looking to improve your study skills, I'm happy to offer guidance and support.  Please feel free to connect!

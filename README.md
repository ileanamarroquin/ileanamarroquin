### Welcome to my GitHub! âœ¨

My name is Ileana, and I'm a passionate data analysis enthusiast.My research interests include Public Economics and Governance. Before graduate school, I explored real-world applications as a Consultant in Washigton D.C, Costa Rica and El Salvador. Currently, I am consulting for the World Bank, supporting research on how to innovate bureaucracies.

Beyond research, I also offer academic mentoring to latinx individuals seeking guidance on navigating the academic landscape. Whether you're also a first-generation student or simply striving to refine your study skills, my door is always open. Feel free to reach out!
